Encode and stream a video with [Play2](http://playframework.org "PlayFramework") & [playCLI](https://github.com/gre/playCLI "playCLI")

# Usage

* create a folder called _videos_ at the root of the application
* drop videos files in it
* go to localhost:9000/

# Notes

If you want to stream videos in OGG vorbis/theora you will have to get a ffmpeg version compiled with '--enable-libtheora' and '--enable-libvorbis'.

To check if your version is ok do : *ffmpeg -version* and look at the configuration line.
